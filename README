This client is written in PHP and does not rely on other tools or installations

The software will retrieve DNS records from any given DNS server, and convert them to proper PHP objects for further processing.

All different DNS record types have their own object in the repository.

Portions of this system are derived from the PHP DNS client by David Cutting https://github.com/purplepixie/phpdns
